    def killinSpree (self, n):
        import math as m
        sq=int(m.sqrt(n))
        i=1
        j=sq+1
        while(i<=j):
            mid=(i+j)>>1
            if(((mid*(mid+1)*((2*mid)+1))//6)==n):
                return(mid)
            elif(((mid*(mid+1)*((2*mid)+1))//6)<n):
                i=mid+1
            else:
                j=mid-1
        return(i-1)
